          <p class="site__description">
              So, what is the fastest way to achieve that level of competence? The answer to this question is simple: slow, regular, and persistent practice.  </br></br>
              Slow Practice </br>
              By slow, I mean we should practice pieces in a slow tempo. Even the fast tempo pieces should be 
              practiced this way. The tempo will become easy if you will know the piece very well. There are various
               practice techniques that help achieve fast tempo but generally speaking, we have to take such practice tempo in which we would avoid making mistakes. </br></br>
              Regular Practice </br>
              In addition, we have to practice regularly. By regular practice, I mean that ideally we should practice
               every day. It does not always have to be two or more hours of practice, but try not to skip practicing. 
               Even if you have only 20 minutes available, repeat the work that you practiced the day before and it will become a little better every time you practice it. </br>
              There is a saying among organists, that if we skip one day without practice, then only we notice it. If
               we don't practice for two days, then our teacher will start noticing it. If we spend three days without practice, then everyone will notice it. </br></br>
              Persistent Practice </br>
              Finally, it is important that we have persistence in practice. For example, what do we do if we find a
               challenging spot in the music and we make mistakes? There are three options:
              1) correct the mistakes </br>2) play with mistakes </br>3) choose another piece</br>
              Ideally, we should strive for option 1. And that often takes persistence. Very often we will get 
              discouraged by the difficult places in a piece. We don't always see the solution very clearly. But if we have persistence, 
              then we'll find the way out eventually. By the way, option 3 might be a good solution, if the piece is too difficult to play comparing with our current level of ability.
