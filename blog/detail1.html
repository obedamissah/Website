          <p class="site__description">
              I was already a husband and a father in grade 3! Each time I reminisced how I got myself married that early,
              a blast of hot air smacked my face with an ambivalent feeling because such a rough-ride situation changed my destiny;
              I wondered how better or worse I could have been than my current personality. Years after, I now have a strong conviction
              that I would not have been any better without my new family -a reshuffled one.
              Many people tell stories about their experiences to establish the fact that every situational change in an individual's life counts
              significantly to personality development -Steve Jobs dropped out of Reed College and eventually developed an intrinsic drive to pursue
              Macintosh, and Apple later. Likewise, Malcom X's autobiography reveals that his intellectual pursuit began after his civil status changed
              from a freeman to a convict -an unfortunate situation. Such unlucky experience, nevertheless, furnished him into an excellent
              personality in the world of literature. My own experience with my family yields a point that affirms this social concept:
              a worthwhile personality change through situational changes.</br></br>

             
              We had lost a piece of our hearts and who could suffice? Who could bring back that enticing relationship that bolstered
              the family spirit? Me! That was how I turned into a husband to mum, a father to my younger sister and a real brother to
              the older one- The Trinity in Me!</br></br>

              Now, let's start with my wife!
              I really loved our marriage precepts. She once told me, "Sweetheart, one relevant thing to help you become the successful
              husband I once had is honesty. Never lie to anyone, including yourself. Liars Are Bold Cowards!" She consistently explained
              the value of honesty and showed me that every bad situation in the world began with a lie. When a person compromises on
              his value, he lies to the law and lies to himself too. She often tells me that being a real husband means facing the
              truth. I reflect on her admonitions in each moment I get into such struggles.</br>

              My wife's teachings cured my selfishness and taught me the values of sharing and giving. I believe that the
              greatest deed in society is to provide someone something he really needs and watch his positive facial expression.
              And, the least gift to offer anyone on earth is a long hug. Well, I believe she's the sweetest person anyone can dream
              of having. I am thankful for everything she taught me about life now and beyond, and I love her for that!</br></br>

              Next, was to groom my daughter through an eclectic education. As her father, I always motivated and directed her
              aspirations to the 'right'. I stood by her side and whenever she fell down in her life pursuits, I encouraged her
              to stand up by herself. My daughter, although diligent, needed such inspiration to reach the apex of her learning
              ability. I was her teacher! Before I taught her the morally right intellectual behaviors, I had to be a paragon of
              such virtues. Indirectly, she honed the leadership abilities in me. A reflection of Malcolm's life story inspires
              me in growing as a leader since he stands as a leading light of the aspiring population of public speakers and writers
              of our time -a father and a teacher just like me!</br></br>

              For my real sister, she always taught, reminded and let me see how hard she always tried in her academia, music,
              and other pursuits as I got more acquainted with her. She was that inspirational erudite! As a result, I could realize
              her reason for studying always and taking more seriously education. She has been my shepherdess, ambition guide, and
              intellect stimulant.</br></br>

              My dad's absence made my heart grow courageous and honest through my wife and shaped me into an intellectually
              independent and responsible leader through my daughter. My real sister made me determined for excellence too, as a
              virtuoso in music and academics. I exchanged a personality for a personality -the trinity.</br></br>

              My conviction about life's basic lessons -rightful personality transformation through situational changes -has
              waxed more than before, and has increased my passion to make new relations in wherever I find myself for discerning
              other worthy and strong personality progressions in me. Now, I can smile and say that I am what I am because of my family
              and whatever development in my character is mostly credited to them!
