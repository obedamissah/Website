          <p class="site__description">
              How did I feel before my first programming project? -NERVOUS because I did not have a teammate because nobody 
              wanted to work with 'the amateur who might slow down progress'. It was a disheartening sight when I saw bright 
              kids who also had no teammates and decided to work as individuals. They were really talented and their egos puffed
               up so that they would not want to even work with each other. Well, I was not alone. I found a CS greenhorn in the same class and decided to work with him.
              Some people abhor the idea of pair programming. And their thoughts sound like:
              'I don't think that's going to work. What if I need to write code and my partner isn't available?' What if we disagree on the same way to solving a problem?'
              'Creativity is relative and can hinder progress!'
              'I can work alone; group work slows me down to zero.'

              Sounds reasonable, right? Yeah, but pair programming does more good than harm to upcoming programmers. Creativity
               may be relative but hinders progress only when both parties decide not to learn from each other. A yielding pair 
               learn from each other's creative ideas -when one is preferred, the other is deferred for a suitable project other than being aborted.
              Consistent communication grows like-mindedness. It is said that great minds think alike; vice versa, like-minds are
               great and therefore produce excellent results in every task however simple it is. After couple of weeks, my partner 
               and I got fond of each other and found ourselves at the zenith of the game. Such a remarkable phenomenon! I found myself in a real team which I had real conversations and entrusted work ethic.

              Pair programming taught me how to work in a team. Initially, I run into a personality clash with my partner -he was quite an introvert and even had hard times
               expressing his creative views. Sometimes he needed motivation; other times, he need pressure to work. All in all,
                I developed a great skill which will bolster me through my future career. Learning together was a great deal not only
                 because it instilled in me work ethics such as teamwork skills and communication tactics, but also it
                  revealed how easier and faster problems could be solved when great minds and determined hearts are pursue a task together.
