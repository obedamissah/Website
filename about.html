                                        Mathematics from Amherst College. In my free time, I study human computer interface and the psychology of human computer interaction. I am
                                        both driven and self-motivated, and I am constantly reading and experimenting with new technologies and techniques. I am very passionate about
                                        both Web Designing and Web Development, and strive to better myself even as a student developer, and the development community as a whole. My passion
                                        stretches to software development too!</br></br>
                                        I have been self-studying coding and my web-based proficiency stretches from HTML/HTML5, CSS/CSS3,  JavaScript, and  jQuery to name a
                                        few. I am also proficient in many non-web-based languages, including but not limited to Java, C/C++ and Python projects on my own and also in groups. </br></br>
                                        In the near future(December 2018), I look forward to establishing a coding facet for middle school students in Takoradi, Ghana, where there is less
                                        or almost no knowledge of web designing and development.
                                        I value honesty, respect, passion, and being genuine. I believe in making tomorrow a better place than today.

    <p>"<span style="font-size: 30px;font-family:chalkduster;"><i><b>V</b></i></span>ery few artists can claim to have the same profound impact on the world of music as Obed has had.
    As an organist, growing-educator and philanthropist, as well as an influential ambassador for the arts Obed has fully
    embraced new technology and innovation, leading the way in bringing classical music into the 21stcentury.
    Obed is a master of communicating through music. As a keyboard prodigy, he started accompanying choral groups
    at age 11 before joining Harmony Choir as a music director.</br></br>
    Gifted with unique artistic and communicative skills, Obed unites excellence and accessibility unlike anyone else,
    and builds bridges between African and Western culture.
    As part of his commitment to the education of children, he founded the "OB SKolA Foundation" which has
    contributed to education and support for children in Ghana and aimed at cultivating tomorrow's leaders.</br></br>
    He gave organ solo recitals at the National Theater of Ghana, the British Council Hall, the State Banquet Hall and on a
    national television show to support child education. In addition,  he performed Handel's Messiah oratorio as the pianist with the National Symphony Orchestra of Ghana to raise funds in aid of childhood cancer.</br></br>
    Obed's repertoire -from the complete works of J. S. Bach to current composers is probably the most diverse
    of any Ghanaian organist. He appears as a soloist with many of Ghanaian choral groups.
    A virtuoso performer unique among keyboardists, Obed's approach to the organ is smashing the stereotypes
    of organists and organ music while generating a level of acclaim, and exposure, unprecedented
    for Ghanaian musicians." </br><p>~Solomon Appoh (Executive Director of Harmony Choir).</p>

                                     This idea or innovation for a needed change drove me to establish <b>OB-SKolA Foundation</b> </br></br>
                                    Since its inception, the foundation has been dedicated to eliminating poverty in 
                                    the community and globally. I believe that through education and action I can elevate my 
                                    community's well-being and change the world one step at a time. In a short while, I envision 
                                    involving more artists, social activists, community leaders and youth who believe that a sustainable 
                                    and abundant society is possible, where tools and resources are available to help benefit the overall welfare of the needy.
                                    </br></br>
                                    I believe that the initiatives provided through OB-SKolA Foundation will stimulate new discoveries, 
                                    increase capacity, broaden opportunities for inclusion, celebrate innovation and capitalize on both 
                                    collective and individual development, so that ultimately community collaboration becomes the default approach to social change in Ghana.
